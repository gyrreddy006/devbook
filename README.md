- **Instant Booking System**: Customers can book developers instantly based on availability.
- **Crypto Payments**: Payments are made using cryptocurrency (e.g., USDC).
- **Instant Video Call**: After booking, a video call is initiated immediately.
- **Real-Time Availability**: Developers can set their real-time availability status.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js
  - Redux (for state management)
  - WebSocket or Socket.io (for real-time updates)
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB or PostgreSQL (for database)
- **Video Call Integration**:
  - WebRTC, Twilio, or Agora
- **Crypto Payments**:
  - Coinbase Commerce or Crypto.com
  - MetaMask or WalletConnect for crypto wallet integration
- **Authentication**: 
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Deployment**: 
  - AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean, or any cloud service provider

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version >= 14)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (for database setup)
- A crypto wallet like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for testing crypto payments
- A **Twilio** or **Agora** account for video call integration

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quick-dev-booking.git
   cd quick-dev-booking
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install both the frontend and backend dependencies:

   - **Frontend**:
     - Navigate to the frontend directory:

       ```bash
       cd frontend
       npm install
       ```

   - **Backend**:
     - Navigate to the backend directory:

       ```bash
       cd backend
       npm install
       ```

3. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in both the **frontend** and **backend** directories to configure environment variables. Example for backend:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   CRYPTO_PAYMENT_API_KEY=your-crypto-api-key
   VIDEO_CALL_API_KEY=your-video-call-api-key
   ```

   Example for frontend:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   REACT_APP_VIDEO_CALL_API_KEY=your-video-call-api-key
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   - **Backend**:
     - Navigate to the backend directory and start the server:

       ```bash
       cd backend
       npm run dev
       ```

   - **Frontend**:
     - In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and start the client:

       ```bash
       cd frontend
       npm start
       ```

   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and `http://localhost:5000` (backend).

## Usage

1. **Developer Registration**:
   - Developers can sign up and set their **profile**, including their **hourly rate**, skills, and **availability**.
   
2. **Booking Process**:
   - Customers can browse through available developers.
   - Once a developer is selected, the customer can **book** the developer for a video call.
   - After booking, the customer will be prompted to pay using **cryptocurrency** (USDC or other supported cryptocurrencies).
   
3. **Video Call**:
   - After successful payment, a **video call** will automatically start between the customer and the developer using **WebRTC**, **Twilio**, or **Agora**.
